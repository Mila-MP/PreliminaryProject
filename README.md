# Bakery Inventory and Workflow Tracker

This project is a preliminary implementation designed to model a hypothetical bakery environment.
It was developed as part of a scoping study to explore the development of a workflow tracking system.
The bakery environment serves as a simplified analogy to laboratory settings, sharing critical similarities such
as protocol adherence, precision in measurements, use of specialized equipment, and the necessity of detailed record-keeping.
